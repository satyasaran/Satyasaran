## Hi there 👋  
# 👋 I’m Satyasaran Changdar  

## About Me  
AI Engineer and Research Scientist with expertise in **Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), Applied Mathematics, and Statistics**.  
I have experience with **LLMs (fine-tuning, agentic AI), vision foundation models, MLOps, cloud services (Azure/AWS/GCP), and quantum ML**.  
Currently an **Assistant Professor at the University of Copenhagen**, working on **sustainable food formulation** and **food process modeling using physics-informed machine learning**.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on: Agentic AI for food research automation (CrewAI, LLMs, small language models), scientific ML/DL for sustainable food formulation, and quantum ML/optimization for real-world problems.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: Quantum computing with Qiskit, advanced MLOps practices, and small/edge AI models (Google AI Edge, NVIDIA Jetson).  
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on: Applied AI/ML projects in **food, healthcare, and sustainability**, especially those integrating multimodal data (images, text, sensors).  
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with: Scaling **symbolic regression** and **PINNs** to large, real-world industrial systems.  
- 💬 Ask me about: Machine learning, deep learning, LLMs, agentic AI, computer vision, symbolic regression, and quantum ML.  
- 📫 How to reach me: [satyasaran@gmail.com](mailto:satyasaran@gmail.com) · [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/satyasaran-changdar) · [GitHub](https://github.com/satyasaran)  
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him  
- ⚡ Fun fact: I’ve bridged careers from mathematics and engineering to AI research — from **bio-nano-fluid dynamics** to **quantum ML**!
