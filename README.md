## Hi there ðŸ‘‹  
# ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Satyasaran Changdar  

## About Me  
AI Engineer and Research Scientist with expertise in **Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), Applied Mathematics, and Statistics**.  
I have experience with **LLMs (fine-tuning, agentic AI), vision foundation models, MLOps, cloud services (Azure/AWS/GCP), and quantum ML**.  
Currently an **Assistant Professor at the University of Copenhagen**, working on **sustainable food formulation** and **food process modeling using physics-informed machine learning and predictive ML modelling**.

  ## ðŸ§  Previous Deep Learning Research Work  
Some selected earlier projects (link: https://satyasaran.github.io/):  

- **RadiMax: Machine Learning for Understanding Plant Root Function**  
  Built deep learning models (CNNs) to extract sub-soil root length (Sqrt_pRLD) from images in the RadiMax facility, linking root traits to water and nitrogen uptake in crops.  

- **RadiMax: Deep Learning for Sub-soil Image Analysis**  
  Applied **ResNet50** transfer learning to create regression and classification models estimating root length and analyzing deep root function.  

- **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for Blood Flow PDEs**  
  Implemented PINNs with **DeepXDE** to solve nonlinear PDEs modeling arterial blood flow under viscoelastic and magnetic effects, optimized with Bayesian methods.  

- **Brain Tumor Segmentation with Multi-Planner U-Net (MPUnet)**  
  Designed an automated segmentation pipeline for pediatric brain MRI, achieving robust tumor core and subregion detection across challenging datasets.
