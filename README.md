## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Satyasaran Changdar  

## About Me  
AI Engineer and Research Scientist with expertise in **Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), Applied Mathematics, and Statistics**.  
I have experience with **LLMs (fine-tuning, agentic AI), vision foundation models, MLOps, cloud services (Azure/AWS/GCP), and quantum ML**.  
Currently an **Assistant Professor at the University of Copenhagen**, working on sustainable food formulation, healthcare AI, and quantum optimization.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on: Agentic AI for food research automation (CrewAI, LLMs, small language models), scientific ML/DL for sustainable food formulation, and quantum ML/optimization for real-world problems.  
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: Quantum computing with Qiskit, advanced MLOps practices, and small/edge AI models (Google AI Edge, NVIDIA Jetson).  
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on: Applied AI/ML projects in **food, healthcare, and sustainability**, especially those integrating multimodal data (images, text, sensors).  
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with: Scaling **symbolic regression** and **PINNs** to large, real-world industrial systems.  
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: Machine learning, deep learning, LLMs, agentic AI, computer vision, symbolic regression, and quantum ML.
