## Hi there ðŸ‘‹  
# ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Satyasaran Changdar  

## About Me  
AI Engineer and Research Scientist with expertise in **Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), Applied Mathematics, and Statistics**.  
I have experience with **LLMs (fine-tuning, agentic AI), vision foundation models, MLOps, cloud services (Azure/AWS/GCP), and quantum ML**.  
Currently an **Assistant Professor at the University of Copenhagen**, working on **sustainable food formulation** and **food process modeling using physics-informed machine learning**.
